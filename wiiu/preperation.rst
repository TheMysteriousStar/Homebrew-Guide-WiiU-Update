Preparations
============

This section of the guide will help you to prepare everything.
    
Step 0: What You Will Need
--------------------------

* A SD Card (or Micro SD card + adapter)

    * We recommend a SD with at least 4GB+ even if not needed. A small SD card is enough to get CFW running, but larger ones are preferred for installing games and performing NAND backups efficiently.
    * If you want to backup your Wii U, you should use a SD at least twice the size of your console (16GB for the white console and 64GB for the black one)

* A working internet connection on your Wii U

    * The browser exploit requires internet (Crazy, I know). If you decide to install Haxchi this is only needed once however.

Step 1: Format your SD Card
---------------------------

The Wii U needs a FAT32 formatted SD card. However unlike the Switch, **only FAT32 works!**. If you need to format your SD on Windows and you can't find FAT32 as a selectable option, use `guiformat <http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm>`_ and set the Allocation Unit Size to 32K (32768).

.. important::

    **Don't call your SD "wiiu", this will cause problems later on**

........

Step 2: Download Tiramisu
-----------------------------

1. Grab the latest version of Tiramisu from `https://tiramisu.foryour.cafe/ <https://tiramisu.foryour.cafe/>`_
2. Insert your SD card into your PC
3. extract the ZIP's contents to the SD Card

Congratulations, we're done with preparations.
