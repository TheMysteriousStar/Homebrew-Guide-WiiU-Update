Aroma

Aroma is a work-in progress environment. Aroma adds support for Modules (which run in the background and improve functionality of the Wii U), Plugins (which can change and add new features to your Wii U) and Wii U Homebrew Bundles (WUHB), and launching homebrew from the Wii U Menu directly (homebrew_on_menu plugin).
